The culprits just rummaged through everything in in the residents rooms and closet looking for something specific. The resident feels very fortunate that their valuables weren’t taken and their animals, while very shaken up, were not hurt. They did shatter the patio door and kicked in a bedroom door but again, nothing was taken. It appears the culprits might have had the wrong house, however, it is important that as a community you are all alert and that you report anything suspicious to the police immediately.",
